React-testing-library: 

in this example project, I create two sample Apps
    1)counter
    2)Refs

in the counter i have used useState to set the state. I have utilized testing-library to test this component

second example is have create a component which renders input and button. I have set the value of input using the useRef and with useEffect i am setting the name value to localstorage.
